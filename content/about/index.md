I want to write a brief summary about my blog which is  broadly about IT systems, technology and my 
experiences with it over the years. I cover topics ranging from Cyber Security, Devops and IT System Engineering. 
Additionally I write about other topics that interest me such as DIY Home Improvements,  Physical Fitness and BJJ. 
In my writings - while still reviewing the technical and procedural aspects of any given topic - I strive to also 
distill and present the philosophical and first principles perspectives that underpin the given topic. I do so by either 
going over them in the respective post or linking to articles in this blog and across the internet that attempt to do that.
